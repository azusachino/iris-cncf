# ArgoCD Application: guestbook-app
#
# This manifest defines an ArgoCD Application resource.
# ArgoCD will monitor the specified Git repository and automatically
# sync the Kubernetes manifests to the target cluster.
#
# This is the core of the GitOps workflow. Any changes pushed to the
# `main` branch of the repository will be automatically deployed.
