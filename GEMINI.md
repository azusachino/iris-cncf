# Gemini Project Overview: IRIS-CNCF

This directory is a personal learning repository focused on cloud architecture, CNCF technologies, and Infrastructure as Code (IaC). It is a non-code project, containing documentation, configuration files, and scripts for educational purposes.

## Directory Overview

The repository is structured to cover several key areas of cloud and cloud-native technologies:

- **`aws-sap-review/`**: Contains notes and resources for the AWS Solutions Architect Professional certification.
- **`cncf-real-world/`**: Provides real-world examples and scenarios for using CNCF projects, particularly Kubernetes.
- **`cross-cloud-comparison/`**: Includes information and comparisons of services across different cloud providers.
- **`ansible-mastery/`**: Contains Ansible playbooks for infrastructure automation.
- **`terraform-mastery/`**: Contains Terraform configurations for managing multi-cloud infrastructure.

## Key Files

- **`README.md`**: The main entry point for the repository, explaining its purpose, structure, and learning path.
- **`ansible-mastery/playbooks/k8s-cluster-setup.yml`**: An Ansible playbook for setting up a Kubernetes cluster. This demonstrates the practical, hands-on nature of the repository's content.
- **`terraform-mastery/multi-cloud/k8s-cluster/main.tf`**: A Terraform configuration for deploying Kubernetes clusters across AWS, Azure, and GCP. This highlights the multi-cloud and IaC focus of the repository.

## Usage

This repository is intended for self-study and reference. The contents can be used to:

- Prepare for cloud certifications (AWS, CKA, etc.).
- Learn how to use Ansible and Terraform for infrastructure automation.
- Understand real-world cloud-native and multi-cloud architecture patterns.

The Ansible playbooks and Terraform configurations can be run with the appropriate tools (e.g., `ansible-playbook`, `terraform apply`) to create and manage infrastructure.
